Although baby goods stores today have an extraordinarily extensive selection, it can still be difficult to find exactly what new parents will enjoy and use.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Additionally, the newborn will outgrow any clothing, toys, or other items of a similar nature very fast because kids grow at an almost cosmic rate, therefore the ideal gift for such an occasion should be something that the family can truly cherish for years to come. In this situation, a gift certificate for a newborn photo session would be fantastic, and the whole family would love it.&lt;/p>

&lt;h1 id="a-photo-shoot-gift-certificate-for-a-newborn-or-older-baby-is-the-ideal-baby-arrival-gift">A photo shoot gift certificate for a newborn or older baby is the ideal baby arrival gift.&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>A gift certificate becomes a truly valuable gift when the parents may decide when and under what conditions to use it. Others will find it more comfortable to employ a professional newborn photographer. Some families will undoubtedly prefer the baby&amp;rsquo;s first photo shoot to take place at home. Such flexibility is certainly conceivable, as are several possibilities for delivering finished photos, creating the baby&amp;rsquo;s first photo book, and other options, which are only constrained by the nominal amount of the gift certificate. The greatest amount of freedom in using a gift certificate makes it the ideal present for a family with a newborn baby, especially since the certificate&amp;rsquo;s validity can last up to a year.&lt;/p>

&lt;h1 id="should-a-gift-for-a-babys-birth-be-a-surprise-or-not">Should a gift for a baby&amp;rsquo;s birth be a surprise or not?&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>It is important to think carefully about whether you should surprise the parents with a gift for the arrival of the baby or if it would be better to let them know in advance that you would want to give them a gift certificate for a newborn photo shoot. There are various reasons why it is preferable to inform new parents of your wish in order to avoid uncomfortable circumstances.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You should first confirm that the family you intend to present your gift to is okay with having a photo session for their new baby. Even though this kind of photography is getting more and more common, many parents still choose not to take the very first images of their newborn because of customs and superstitions. A gift certificate in this situation will only result in disappointment.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The second reason is how the process is organized: if you want to make a surprise, the givers may decide to schedule their own newborn photo session with a different newborn photographer without being aware of your plan. Additionally, it is preferable to plan the date in advance with the preferred photographer to reduce the likelihood that the schedule will be full when the baby is delivered. It is therefore important to talk about such a birth gift in advance.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Here are 10 tips for preparing for your newborn photography session:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Choose the right newborn photographer: Your newborn photographer should have experience with newborn photography and a portfolio that showcases their skills. Look for someone who has a warm, nurturing demeanor and a gentle touch, as newborns can be delicate.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;figure id="figure-newborn-photo-session-in-the-studio">
&lt;div class="d-flex justify-content-center">
&lt;div class="w-100" >&lt;img src="./newborn-photo-shoot-2.jpg" alt="Newborn photo session in the studio" loading="lazy" data-zoomable />&lt;/div>
&lt;/div>&lt;figcaption>

&lt;/figcaption>&lt;/figure>
&lt;ol start="2">
&lt;li>Plan ahead: Newborn photography sessions are typically held within the first two weeks of a baby&amp;rsquo;s life, so it&amp;rsquo;s important to book your session as early as possible. This will ensure that you have a spot on the photographer&amp;rsquo;s schedule and give you plenty of time to prepare.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>

&lt;/div>&lt;figcaption>

&lt;ol start="3">
&lt;li>Create a comfortable environment: Make sure that the room where the photography session will take place is warm and comfortable for your newborn.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>

&lt;/div>&lt;figcaption>

&lt;/figcaption>&lt;/figure>
&lt;ol start="4">
&lt;li>Dress your newborn in loose-fitting clothes: Tight clothing can restrict your newborn&amp;rsquo;s movement and make them uncomfortable during the session. Choose loose-fitting, comfortable clothes that will allow your baby to move freely.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>

&lt;/div>&lt;figcaption>

&lt;/figcaption>&lt;/figure>
&lt;ol start="5">
&lt;li>Bring along some necessary items: Your newborn photographer may ask you to bring along certain items for the session, such as a pacifier, extra diapers, and a blanket. It&amp;rsquo;s also a good idea to bring along some extra clothes in case of any accidents.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>

&lt;/div>&lt;figcaption>

&lt;ol start="6">
&lt;li>Plan for feeding and diaper changes: Newborns have small stomachs and will need to be fed frequently, so it&amp;rsquo;s important to plan for regular feeding and diaper changes during the session.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>

&lt;/div>&lt;figcaption>

&lt;ol start="7">
&lt;li>Consider the time of day: The best time for newborn photography is typically early in the morning or late in the afternoon, when the light is softer and more natural.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;figure id="figure-newborn-photo-session-in-the-studio-in-tallinn">

&lt;ol start="8">
&lt;li>Be patient: Newborns can be unpredictable, and it&amp;rsquo;s important to be patient and understanding during the session. It&amp;rsquo;s okay if things don&amp;rsquo;t go according to plan â the most important thing is to capture beautiful memories of your newborn.&lt;/li>

&lt;li>Relax and have fun: While it&amp;rsquo;s important to be prepared, it&amp;rsquo;s also important to relax and have fun during the session. These memories will be special for years to come, so try to enjoy the experience and let the photographer capture your newborn&amp;rsquo;s unique personality.&lt;/li>

&lt;p>When you think: âI photographed so many babies, I canât be surprised by anythingâ.. but no ð Nonetheless experience allows to give incredibly beautiful shots to every family. â£ï¸ For all the time I worked with newborn babies, there was only one photo shoot, when I invited parents to come to the studio for the second time, because after the photo shoot I realized that there were very few shots. And it was not because I could not find an approach to the baby, and not because the Baby was worried about the tummy.. It happens. For reasons beyond anyone&amp;rsquo;s control ð¤·ð»ââï¸ we did a second shoot in a couple of days and it was a great job.â£ï¸&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Why am I writing about this ð if it seems to you that at photo shoots all the babies sleep sweetly and soundly, and the photographer just presses a button, know that it is not. A newborn photo shoot is a very narrow and most difficult direction in photography. Try to relax while shooting (after all, a calm mom = a calm baby ð), enjoy the process and later the result!â£ï¸&lt;/p>

Let&amp;rsquo;s figure it out.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Doctors and newborn photographers define the so-called neonatal period in different ways.&lt;/p>
&lt;figure id="figure-newborn-photo-shoot-in-tallinn">
&lt;div class="d-flex justify-content-center">
&lt;div class="w-100" >&lt;img src="./newborn-photo-shoot-1.jpg" alt="Newborn photo shoot in Tallinn" loading="lazy" data-zoomable />&lt;/div>
&lt;/div>&lt;figcaption>

&lt;/figcaption>&lt;/figure>
&lt;h1 id="neonatal-period-for-doctors">Neonatal period for doctors&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>Doctors determine the neonatal period at 28 days from the moment the baby is born. It takes so much time for a newborn baby to adapt to a new environment. It is expressed by one of the most important properties of the body - in the first four weeks of life a newborn baby usually sleeps a lot. After this period a completely different life begins - rapid development, increased activity, periods of sleep are reduced and periods of wakefulness are lengthened.&lt;/p>
&lt;figure id="figure-newborn-photo-shoot">
&lt;div class="d-flex justify-content-center">
&lt;div class="w-100" >&lt;img src="./newborn-photo-shoot-2.jpg" alt="Newborn photo shoot" loading="lazy" data-zoomable />&lt;/div>
&lt;/div>&lt;figcaption>

&lt;/figcaption>&lt;/figure>
&lt;h1 id="what-do-newborn-photographers-think">What do newborn photographers think?&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>For newborn photographers the period suitable for a newborn photo shoot is usually the first two weeks of a baby&amp;rsquo;s life. &lt;em>Why so?&lt;/em> It&amp;rsquo;s simple: most often during this period the baby&amp;rsquo;s sleep is as strong and calm as possible. The baby cannot be awakened either by laying in the desired position or by changing clothes. The baby sleeps peacefully and the photographer calmly works.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, this does not mean that it will not be possible to photograph the baby in the next two weeks. Itâs just that the duration of the photo session may increase and, perhaps, the baby will not be able to be put in all the desired poses.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Therefore, a newborn photo shoot should be booked in advance, preferably in the last months of pregnancy. Or contact the newborn photographer as soon as possible after the birth.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>It was not possible to make a photo shoot of a newborn during the recommended period, but you still want to have newborn pictures? No problem! But do not put off the first photo shoot of your baby for an indefinite period. Keep in mind that every day your baby&amp;rsquo;s sleep becomes more and more sensitive. In addition, colic may begin to bother the baby. Therefore, if you have booked a photo shoot for a approximately one month old baby it is best to act according to the situation during the photo shoot. You can plan the set-ups and discuss the desired poses with the newborn photographer, but, unfortunately, the photographer cannot give guarantees that everything planned will be realized. The best solution would be to abandon difficult poses and shoot based on the mood of the small model. In this case there will be less expectations and the atmosphere at the photo shoot will be more comfortable so you will certainly get many beautiful photos.&lt;/p>

And I am no exception: my favorite pose on the tummy.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Insanely touching, with a touching deflection in the back and legs folded in a &amp;ldquo;bow&amp;rdquo;, it is ideal for both near and distant shots&amp;hellip; Photos in this pose are chosen by parents most often for printing.&lt;/p>

&lt;/div>&lt;figcaption>

&lt;p>But, in spite of its seemingly naturalness, it is not so easy to lay the baby in this pose. Hypertonicity, colic, and insufficient experience of the photographer can interfere.
But I always succeed.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It is especially cool when it turns out to connect the elbow with the bent knee.&lt;/p>

&lt;/div>&lt;figcaption>

&lt;p>But photography of newborns does not tolerate fanaticism, it requires maximum care and sensitivity. Therefore, if the baby from my third attempt does not fit into posing &amp;ldquo;according to the book&amp;rdquo;, then I do not insist, but I am looking for an option that suits both of us. Moreover, the &amp;ldquo;on the tummy&amp;rdquo; pose is beautiful in any interpretation. â¥ ï¸&lt;/p>
