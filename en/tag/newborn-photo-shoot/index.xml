Although baby goods stores today have an extraordinarily extensive selection, it can still be difficult to find exactly what new parents will enjoy and use.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Additionally, the newborn will outgrow any clothing, toys, or other items of a similar nature very fast because kids grow at an almost cosmic rate, therefore the ideal gift for such an occasion should be something that the family can truly cherish for years to come. In this situation, a gift certificate for a newborn photo session would be fantastic, and the whole family would love it.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>A gift certificate becomes a truly valuable gift when the parents may decide when and under what conditions to use it. Others will find it more comfortable to employ a professional newborn photographer. Some families will undoubtedly prefer the baby&amp;rsquo;s first photo shoot to take place at home. Such flexibility is certainly conceivable, as are several possibilities for delivering finished photos, creating the baby&amp;rsquo;s first photo book, and other options, which are only constrained by the nominal amount of the gift certificate. The greatest amount of freedom in using a gift certificate makes it the ideal present for a family with a newborn baby, especially since the certificate&amp;rsquo;s validity can last up to a year.&lt;/p>

&lt;h2 id="should-a-gift-for-a-babys-birth-be-a-surprise-or-not">Should a gift for a baby&amp;rsquo;s birth be a surprise or not?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>It is important to think carefully about whether you should surprise the parents with a gift for the arrival of the baby or if it would be better to let them know in advance that you would want to give them a gift certificate for a newborn photo shoot. There are various reasons why it is preferable to inform new parents of your wish in order to avoid uncomfortable circumstances.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You should first confirm that the family you intend to present your gift to is okay with having a photo session for their new baby. Even though this kind of photography is getting more and more common, many parents still choose not to take the very first images of their newborn because of customs and superstitions. A gift certificate in this situation will only result in disappointment.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The second reason is how the process is organized: if you want to make a surprise, the givers may decide to schedule their own newborn photo session with a different newborn photographer without being aware of your plan. Additionally, it is preferable to plan the date in advance with the preferred photographer to reduce the likelihood that the schedule will be full when the baby is delivered. It is therefore important to talk about such a birth gift in advance.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Here are 10 tips for preparing for your newborn photography session:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Choose the right newborn photographer: Your newborn photographer should have experience with newborn photography and a portfolio that showcases their skills. Look for someone who has a warm, nurturing demeanor and a gentle touch, as newborns can be delicate.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;figure id="figure-newborn-photo-session-in-the-studio">
&lt;div class="d-flex justify-content-center">
&lt;div class="w-100" >&lt;img src="./newborn-photo-shoot-2.jpg" alt="Newborn photo session in the studio" loading="lazy" data-zoomable />&lt;/div>
&lt;/div>&lt;figcaption>

&lt;/figcaption>&lt;/figure>
&lt;ol start="2">
&lt;li>Plan ahead: Newborn photography sessions are typically held within the first two weeks of a baby&amp;rsquo;s life, so it&amp;rsquo;s important to book your session as early as possible. This will ensure that you have a spot on the photographer&amp;rsquo;s schedule and give you plenty of time to prepare.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>

&lt;/div>&lt;figcaption>

&lt;ol start="3">
&lt;li>Create a comfortable environment: Make sure that the room where the photography session will take place is warm and comfortable for your newborn.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>

&lt;/div>&lt;figcaption>

&lt;/figcaption>&lt;/figure>
&lt;ol start="4">
&lt;li>Dress your newborn in loose-fitting clothes: Tight clothing can restrict your newborn&amp;rsquo;s movement and make them uncomfortable during the session. Choose loose-fitting, comfortable clothes that will allow your baby to move freely.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>

&lt;/div>&lt;figcaption>

&lt;/figcaption>&lt;/figure>
&lt;ol start="5">
&lt;li>Bring along some necessary items: Your newborn photographer may ask you to bring along certain items for the session, such as a pacifier, extra diapers, and a blanket. It&amp;rsquo;s also a good idea to bring along some extra clothes in case of any accidents.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>

&lt;/div>&lt;figcaption>

&lt;ol start="6">
&lt;li>Plan for feeding and diaper changes: Newborns have small stomachs and will need to be fed frequently, so it&amp;rsquo;s important to plan for regular feeding and diaper changes during the session.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>

&lt;/div>&lt;figcaption>

&lt;ol start="7">
&lt;li>Consider the time of day: The best time for newborn photography is typically early in the morning or late in the afternoon, when the light is softer and more natural.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;figure id="figure-newborn-photo-session-in-the-studio-in-tallinn">

&lt;ol start="8">
&lt;li>Be patient: Newborns can be unpredictable, and it&amp;rsquo;s important to be patient and understanding during the session. It&amp;rsquo;s okay if things don&amp;rsquo;t go according to plan – the most important thing is to capture beautiful memories of your newborn.&lt;/li>

&lt;li>Relax and have fun: While it&amp;rsquo;s important to be prepared, it&amp;rsquo;s also important to relax and have fun during the session. These memories will be special for years to come, so try to enjoy the experience and let the photographer capture your newborn&amp;rsquo;s unique personality.&lt;/li>

&lt;p>When you think: “I photographed so many babies, I can’t be surprised by anything”.. but no 😂 Nonetheless experience allows to give incredibly beautiful shots to every family. ❣️ For all the time I worked with newborn babies, there was only one photo shoot, when I invited parents to come to the studio for the second time, because after the photo shoot I realized that there were very few shots. And it was not because I could not find an approach to the baby, and not because the Baby was worried about the tummy.. It happens. For reasons beyond anyone&amp;rsquo;s control 🤷🏻‍♀️ we did a second shoot in a couple of days and it was a great job.❣️&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Why am I writing about this 😀 if it seems to you that at photo shoots all the babies sleep sweetly and soundly, and the photographer just presses a button, know that it is not. A newborn photo shoot is a very narrow and most difficult direction in photography. Try to relax while shooting (after all, a calm mom = a calm baby 😉), enjoy the process and later the result!❣️&lt;/p>

Let&amp;rsquo;s figure it out.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Doctors and newborn photographers define the so-called neonatal period in different ways.&lt;/p>
&lt;figure id="figure-newborn-photo-shoot-in-tallinn">
&lt;div class="d-flex justify-content-center">
&lt;div class="w-100" >&lt;img src="./newborn-photo-shoot-1.jpg" alt="Newborn photo shoot in Tallinn" loading="lazy" data-zoomable />&lt;/div>
&lt;/div>&lt;figcaption>

&lt;/figcaption>&lt;/figure>
&lt;h2 id="neonatal-period-for-doctors">Neonatal period for doctors&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Doctors determine the neonatal period at 28 days from the moment the baby is born. It takes so much time for a newborn baby to adapt to a new environment. It is expressed by one of the most important properties of the body - in the first four weeks of life a newborn baby usually sleeps a lot. After this period a completely different life begins - rapid development, increased activity, periods of sleep are reduced and periods of wakefulness are lengthened.&lt;/p>
&lt;figure id="figure-newborn-photo-shoot">
&lt;div class="d-flex justify-content-center">
&lt;div class="w-100" >&lt;img src="./newborn-photo-shoot-2.jpg" alt="Newborn photo shoot" loading="lazy" data-zoomable />&lt;/div>
&lt;/div>&lt;figcaption>

&lt;/figcaption>&lt;/figure>
&lt;h2 id="what-do-newborn-photographers-think">What do newborn photographers think?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>For newborn photographers the period suitable for a newborn photo shoot is usually the first two weeks of a baby&amp;rsquo;s life. &lt;em>Why so?&lt;/em> It&amp;rsquo;s simple: most often during this period the baby&amp;rsquo;s sleep is as strong and calm as possible. The baby cannot be awakened either by laying in the desired position or by changing clothes. The baby sleeps peacefully and the photographer calmly works.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, this does not mean that it will not be possible to photograph the baby in the next two weeks. It’s just that the duration of the photo session may increase and, perhaps, the baby will not be able to be put in all the desired poses.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Therefore, a newborn photo shoot should be booked in advance, preferably in the last months of pregnancy. Or contact the newborn photographer as soon as possible after the birth.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>It was not possible to make a photo shoot of a newborn during the recommended period, but you still want to have newborn pictures? No problem! But do not put off the first photo shoot of your baby for an indefinite period. Keep in mind that every day your baby&amp;rsquo;s sleep becomes more and more sensitive. In addition, colic may begin to bother the baby. Therefore, if you have booked a photo shoot for a approximately one month old baby it is best to act according to the situation during the photo shoot. You can plan the set-ups and discuss the desired poses with the newborn photographer, but, unfortunately, the photographer cannot give guarantees that everything planned will be realized. The best solution would be to abandon difficult poses and shoot based on the mood of the small model. In this case there will be less expectations and the atmosphere at the photo shoot will be more comfortable so you will certainly get many beautiful photos.&lt;/p>

The feelings and excitement of parents are understandable: long-term shooting can tire the baby.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The duration of the photo session depends on the age of the child. It is difficult to shoot a newborn and an active one-year-old baby for the same time. There will be different tactics and results.&lt;/p>
&lt;figure id="figure-newborn-photo-shoot-in-tallinn">

&lt;h2 id="newborn-photo-shoot-while-the-baby-sleeps">Newborn photo shoot: while the baby sleeps&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The duration of a newborn photo shoot depends on newborn baby character, mood and many other factors. Usually the result of a photo shoot is 90% of the photos where the baby is sleeping. Of course, if the newborn does not fall asleep immediately, I am happy to take photos with eyes open.
Shooting a newborn lasts about 2-3 hours, but does not cause any discomfort to the baby, because at this moment he is sleeping sweetly.&lt;/p>
&lt;figure id="figure-baby-photo-shoot-in-the-studio">
&lt;div class="d-flex justify-content-center">

&lt;h2 id="photo-shoot-of-a-one-year-old-baby-catch-in-an-hour">Photo shoot of a one-year-old baby: catch in an hour&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The older the baby, the longer the periods of his wakefulness. Now a long photo session can really tire.
Therefore, at photo shoots of babies aged from several months to a year, I make the necessary shots as quickly as possible. It is difficult to shoot a one-year-old child for more than an hour. And this is provided that the baby is in a good mood. Sometimes shooting is reduced to half an hour.
But don&amp;rsquo;t worry! During this time, we can make amazing shots. The main thing: &lt;em>photo shoot should give the baby pleasure&lt;/em>. Then the smiles during the shooting will be the most real and sincere.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>For the most part, newborn babies at this time&lt;/p>
&lt;p>🥰 sleep more&lt;/p>
&lt;p>🥰 it is easier to put them in a pose&lt;/p>

&lt;/figcaption>&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>Of course, you can try to sign up for the newborn photo shoot upon the birth of the baby (call as soon as you get well, for 2-3 days), but in this case there is a risk that due to the workload I will not have time to organize everything before 14 days.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Therefore, I strongly advise you to schedule a newborn photo shoot according to the PDB (preliminary date of birth), then I will have a reference point, and the chances of a quiet newborn shooting and beautiful pictures will increase significantly!&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Most mothers who come to me with newborn babies admit that they themselves would hardly have decided on such a photoshoot.
In household chores, both before childbirth and after, the thought somehow does not come to mind that it would be great to keep in mind the very first days of a baby&amp;rsquo;s life.&lt;/p>

&lt;/div>&lt;figcaption>

&lt;p>But, if there is a discerning friend/mother/sister who gives a certificate for a newborn photo shoot, then this, as a result, turns out to be exactly the gift that will be remembered for a lifetime.
After all, the pictures stolen from time by a professional lens are thoroughly imbued with the thrill and tenderness of the newly realized motherhood &amp;hellip; And they are much more valuable than diapers and rattles.&lt;/p>

Newborn photographer tips.</title><link>https://www.xn--vastsndinu-eeb.ee/en/post/newborn-session-the-colour-of-memories-newborn-photographer-tips/</link><pubDate>Sun, 03 Oct 2021 10:00:53 +0300</pubDate><guid>https://www.xn--vastsndinu-eeb.ee/en/post/newborn-session-the-colour-of-memories-newborn-photographer-tips/</guid><description>&lt;p>I have already written about the most appropriate time to shoot a newborn, about the most touching poses &amp;hellip; And today I want to touch on the topic of color.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
&lt;figure >
&lt;div class="d-flex justify-content-center">
&lt;div class="w-100" >&lt;img src="./newborn-photographer-1.jpg" alt="newborn photo shoot" loading="lazy" data-zoomable />&lt;/div>
&lt;/div>&lt;/figure>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Before the newborn session, parents receive a questionnaire from me, one of the points of which is the choice of the color in which the newborn photo shoot will take place. I have fifteen of them to choose from, both for boys and girls.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
&lt;figure >
&lt;div class="d-flex justify-content-center">
&lt;div class="w-100" >&lt;img src="./newborn-photographer-2.jpg" alt="newborn photo shoot in Tallinn" loading="lazy" data-zoomable />&lt;/div>
&lt;/div>&lt;/figure>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It would seem that everything is simple: the color of my husband&amp;rsquo;s favorite football team is red, I also always liked this color: energetic, bright &amp;hellip; take it!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
&lt;figure >
&lt;div class="d-flex justify-content-center">
&lt;div class="w-100" >&lt;img src="./newborn-photographer-3.jpg" alt="newborn session in Tallinn" loading="lazy" data-zoomable />&lt;/div>
&lt;/div>&lt;/figure>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>BUT.
Will scarlet pictures fit into the interior of your home?
And if the baby was born with a distinctly reddish skin tone, are you sure you want to further accentuate it with items of clothing and props? Or, nevertheless, on the contrary, is it better to level this redness with green?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
&lt;figure >
&lt;div class="d-flex justify-content-center">
&lt;div class="w-100" >&lt;img src="./newborn-photographer-4.jpg" alt="newborn session in the studio" loading="lazy" data-zoomable />&lt;/div>
&lt;/div>&lt;/figure>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There are such subtleties that you cannot immediately think of.
But now that you know about them, what color would you choose? Classic blue/pink? Or something more extravagant?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>

&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>How to choose a newborn photographer</title><link>https://www.xn--vastsndinu-eeb.ee/en/post/how-to-choose-a-newborn-photographer/</link><pubDate>Sat, 02 Oct 2021 10:00:53 +0300</pubDate><guid>https://www.xn--vastsndinu-eeb.ee/en/post/how-to-choose-a-newborn-photographer/</guid><description>&lt;p>Choosing a photographer for your newborn baby is a very responsible thing. The newborn photography market is developing very quickly and a large number of photographers offer their services.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>How not to be mistaken with the choice?&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After all, you do not just choose a photographer, you choose a specialist who will make a photo shoot professionally and safely for the baby.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
&lt;figure >
&lt;div class="d-flex justify-content-center">
&lt;div class="w-100" >&lt;img src="./newborn-photographer-1.jpg" alt="newborn photo shoot" loading="lazy" data-zoomable />&lt;/div>
&lt;/div>&lt;/figure>
&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Start looking for your photographer while you are pregnant. When the baby is born, you simply will not have time for this. And the ideal time (4-15 days) for a photo shoot of a newborn passes imperceptibly.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>
&lt;figure >
&lt;div class="d-flex justify-content-center">
&lt;div class="w-100" >&lt;img src="./newborn-photographer-2.jpg" alt="newborn photo shoot in Tallinn" loading="lazy" data-zoomable />&lt;/div>
&lt;/div>&lt;/figure>
&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Choose a photographer who specializes in newborn photography. Browse through the portfolio. If necessary, ask a photographer to show you a series of photo shoots so you can better understand if a particular style of photography is right for you.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>
&lt;figure >
&lt;div class="d-flex justify-content-center">
&lt;div class="w-100" >&lt;img src="./newborn-photographer-3.jpg" alt="newborn session in Tallinn" loading="lazy" data-zoomable />&lt;/div>
&lt;/div>&lt;/figure>
&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Read reviews from other customers. Ask how long the photographer has specialized in newborn photoshoots, where and from whom he studied.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>
&lt;figure >
&lt;div class="d-flex justify-content-center">
&lt;div class="w-100" >&lt;img src="./newborn-photographer-4.jpg" alt="newborn photo shoot in Tallinn" loading="lazy" data-zoomable />&lt;/div>
&lt;/div>&lt;/figure>
&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Don&amp;rsquo;t choose a photographer based solely on the price of a photo shoot. The price of a newborn photo shoot cannot be low - in addition to the necessary props, which must be purchased and prepared for the photo shoot, a professional newborn photographer must study a lot in order not only to please you with beautiful pictures, but also to ensure the safety of your baby during the photo shoot. Safety is the most important thing in a newborn photo shoot.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Of course, the price of a newborn photo shoot is very important, but don&amp;rsquo;t make it the main criterion.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>

&lt;div class="w-100" >&lt;img src="./newborn-photographer-5.jpg" alt="newborn session in the studio" loading="lazy" data-zoomable />&lt;/div>
&lt;/div>&lt;/figure>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Choose a photographer for your baby, who will give you pictures, looking at which you will remember how tiny your baby was, how thin his fingers were and how you wanted to kiss his sweet toes. ❤️&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
