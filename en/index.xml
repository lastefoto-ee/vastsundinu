Newborn photosession in Tallinn
&lt;/figcaption>&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>Most mothers who come to me with newborn babies admit that they themselves would hardly have decided on such a photoshoot.
In household chores, both before childbirth and after, the thought somehow does not come to mind that it would be great to keep in mind the very first days of a baby&amp;rsquo;s life.&lt;/p>
&lt;figure id="figure-newborn-photosession">

&lt;/div>&lt;figcaption>
Newborn photosession
&lt;/figcaption>&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>But, if there is a discerning friend/mother/sister who gives a certificate for a newborn photosession, then this, as a result, turns out to be exactly the gift that will be remembered for a lifetime.
After all, the pictures stolen from time by a professional lens are thoroughly imbued with the thrill and tenderness of the newly realized motherhood &amp;hellip; And they are much more valuable than diapers and rattles.&lt;/p>
